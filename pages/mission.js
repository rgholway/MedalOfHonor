          The Mission
        </h1>
        <p>
          On October 6, 1969, USAF Major Philip J. Conran of the 21st Special Operations Squadron (SOS) piloted his CH-3 helicopter (Call Sign Knife 62) in combat action in Savannakhet Province, Laos. The USAF personnel, based in Thailand, were attempting to infiltrate the CIA-sponsored irregular Red Battalion into Moung Phine, Savannakhet Province, Laos.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Moung Phine Mission included one CIA Twin Engine Baron, two A-1E fighter aircraft, one H-1 rescue helicopter, and five troop carrying CH-3 helicopters that were transporting approximately 125 SGU’s (Special Guerialla Unit) from a CIA operating location on the Bolovens Plateau in Laos to a reportedly secure landing zone at the Moung Phine Airstrip (LS-300). The objective of these soldiers was to interrupt the flow of North Vietnamese Army (NVA) troops and equipment down the Ho Chi Minh trail into South Vietnam. It was a crucial location along the Ho Chi Minh trail connecting North Vietnam through Laos and into South Vietnam and Cambodia so keeping this trail open was the #1 priority of all NVA troops in Central Laos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of the importance of this location, the NVA had other plans as they had set a trap. They were waiting with anti-aircraft and other heavy weapons and proceeded to shoot down the lead helicopter (Knife 61). USAF Major Conran now became the lead and led the remaining helicopters southeast out of the enemy fire zone while the two A-1 fighter pilots (Hobo 22 and 23) attempted to suppress the enemy fire.  Then, when Knife 61 reported a lull in enemy fire, Major Conran asked the H-1 rescue pilot to pick up the downed Knife 61 crew.  The pilot replied he felt the area was still too dangerous, his helicopter was unarmed, and he was low on fuel.  A quick decision had to be made whether to pull out and return to the base or go in and attempt a rescue of the downed crewmen. Major Conran concluded that there was no chance the men would survive without immediate additional support, so he chose to enter the hostile arena with the 25 Lao soldiers on board his helicopter. Fortunately for those comrades on the ground, Major Conran chose the more dangerous option to land his helicopter to retrieve them or stay and fight.

        <p>
          During Major Conran’s approach, he too, took heavy enemy fire making the helicopter extremely difficult to control but he continued, landed, discharged the Lao soldiers, got the four American airmen on board, and started to lift off before enemy bullets destroyed the helicopter transmission, forcing Major Conran to crash land. The other three helicopters returned to base camp leaving Major Conran and the troops to defend themselves until they received additional air support or were rescued.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon landing, Major Conran took command even though he was not the senior ranking officer.  He immediately set up a defensive perimeter and, during the next six hours, directed the ground forces and coordinated Air Force and Navy bombing runs even after being shot in the leg.

          “Towards the end of the afternoon, I had the A-1s dropping bombs and starting strafing runs right over my head. When I stood up, I could see the enemy so, using my compass, I called for drops on such and such headings commencing right over me. Unfortunately, the enemy could also see me when I was standing up and that was when I got shot. The bullet, when it hit my leg, felt like a hot rod. I guess my adrenaline was sky high, so I didn’t think that much about it until after the rescue and then it hurt like hell“

          Ret. Colonel Philip Conran
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of Major Conran’s decisions and heroic efforts, after six long hours of fighting, 46 Lao Soldiers and 8 Americans were successfully airlifted from Moung Phine.
        </p>
        <p>
          What makes this operation even more remarkable is that Major Conran, while he was a skilled Air Force Pilot, he had no combat training, and yet he was able to successfully perform combat duties similar to a
          Marine Corps or Army combat officer, for over six hours against a far superior and heavily armed NVA force.  Read the supporting details in the Documents section of this website.
