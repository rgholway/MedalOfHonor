          Acknowledgments
        </h1>
        <p>
          We would like to thank our friends and family who have provided
          support over the many years as we’ve tried to reverse this injustice.
          Many of them have written to their Member of Congress asking for
          their support or have reached out to their network to help our cause.
          Without your continued encouragement it would be more difficult to
          keep fighting this battle.
        </p>
        <p>
          We would also like to extend our gratitude to those eyewitnesses who
          were willing to come forward with their accounts of the Moung Phine
          mission and provided letters of support. We know bringing up their
          past wartime experience was not easy. And, we’re very thankful for the
          many military and government officials who have provided extensive
          research, letters of support and continue to help keep the
          conversation alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          The list below constitutes a small collage of military, CIA, and
          government officials who have supported this Medal of Honor
          Recommendation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, of course, to our Dad, who set an example for us to follow.
        </p>
